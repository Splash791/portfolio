          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Iâ€™m drawn to fields where I can combine creativity and problem-solving, especially software engineering, product management, and machine learning. Iâ€™m fascinated by how these areas can be used to create tools and experiences that make everday life easier and more enjoyable.

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Outside of tech, I have a big personal goal: to travel to every country in the world and immerse myself in each culture. I believe the best ideas often come from seeing the world through different perspectives, whether itâ€™s trying new food in a small street market or having conversations with locals halfway across the globe.

          When Iâ€™m not coding or planning my next trip, you might find me cooking something new, lifting at the gym, or brainstorming ideas for my next side project.
